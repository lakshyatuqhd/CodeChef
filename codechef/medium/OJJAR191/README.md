## Problem

### Projects Section

Alright, let's move on to the next challenge!

 **Problem Description:** 

Now it’s time to showcase your work! In this step, you'll be creating the  **"Projects"**  section of your portfolio. This section highlights the projects you’ve built or contributed to, along with brief descriptions and links for visitors to explore them further.

You’ve been given a template with an array—simply update that array by adding your own projects. For each project, include a name, a short description, and a link if available.

 **Note:** 

- The main container for this section should be a <section> element. It must have an id attribute set to projects. It must have a className attribute set to projects-section.
- Inside the <section>, there should be a <div> that acts as a container for all your project cards. This div must have the className="projects-grid".
- Each individual project will be displayed in its own <div>. This div must have the className="project-card".
- You'll be mapping over an array (projectData) to generate these project cards dynamically.
- For the "View Project" links (<a> tags), ensure you include target="_blank" and rel="noopener noreferrer" for good practice when opening new tabs.

 **Your app's "projects" section should aim to look something like this (structure and elements):**

      {/* Grid container for all project cards */}

    </section>

  );
