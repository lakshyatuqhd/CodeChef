## Problem

### View and delete a note

Now we are on the last stage of our first project.

The last functionality we have to implement is viewing a single note and its content and an option to delete it.

#### Task:
- Complete the notes.js code to implement the functionality of viewing a particular note on /:title route. The titile name should not contain the.txt extension. And render the view-note.ejs to show the note on frontend.
- Complete the functionality of deleting the note on /:title/delete route. After deleting the note, go back to /notes route.
- Complete notes.ejs to link all the notes to their particular route and show its content.
- Complete the view-note.ejs to show the title as heading and content of the note. And add the route to delete the particular note.
#### Expected working:
