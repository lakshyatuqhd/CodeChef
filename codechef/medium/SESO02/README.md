## Problem

### Real life implementation
### How Linear Search Works:
- Start from the first element of the list.
- Compare the current element with the target element.
- If a match is found, return the position.
- If no match, move to the next element.
- Repeat until the target is found or the end of the list is reached.
- If the target is not found, the search is unsuccessful.
### Example in a List:

Let's say you have a list of numbers, and you want to find the number $6$:

List: [4,1,6,8]

- Start with the first element (4). Is it 6? No.
- Move to the next element (1). Is it 6? No.
- Move to the next element (6). Is it 6? Yes. You've found the number 6.
- In this example, it took three comparisons to find the number 6.
### Task
- Given the program to check $7$ is present or not, print Yes if $7$ is present in the array.
- Analyze the code for linear search and submit.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Define the array
        int[] array = {3, 5, 2, 9, 7, 1};
        boolean found = false;

        // Check if 7 is present in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; ++i) {
            if (array[i] == 7) {
                found = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        // Print the result
        if (found) {
            System.out.println("Yes");
        } else {
            System.out.println("No");
        }
    }
}

```
