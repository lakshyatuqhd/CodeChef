## Problem

### Simulating a Delayed Greeting

Let's create a program that simulates a delayed greeting. We'll use both synchronous and asynchronous operations to illustrate the difference.

 **The Task:** 

We want to print three greetings: "Hello!", "World!", and "Goodbye!". However, we want to delay the "World!" greeting by 1 second using `setTimeout`. This will demonstrate how asynchronous operations allow the program to continue executing while waiting for the timer to complete.

## Solution

**Language:** C++  
**Runtime:** N/A  
**Memory:** N/A

```cpp
console.log("Hello!");

setTimeout(() => {
    console.log("World!");
    }, 1000);

    console.log("Goodbye!");
```
