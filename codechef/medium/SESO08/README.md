## Problem

### Find Smallest Absolute Difference

Write a program to find the element in an array with the  **smallest absolute difference**  from a given integer  **k**. If there are multiple elements with the same minimum difference, print the smallest of these elements.

### Input Format
- The first line contains two integers n and k, where n is the number of elements in the array and k is the integer against which to compare.
- The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces, representing the elements of the array.
### Output Format
- Print the element in the array with the smallest difference from k. If multiple elements have the same minimum difference, print the smallest of these elements.
### Sample 1:

```java
import java.util.Scanner;

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = scanner.nextInt();
        int k = scanner.nextInt();
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = scanner.nextInt();
        }
        scanner.close();
        
        int min_diff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int diff = Math.abs(arr[i] - k);
            if (diff < min_diff || (diff == min_diff && arr[i] < result)) {
                min_diff = diff;
                result = arr[i];
            }
        }
        
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
