## Problem

### Display a Motivational Quote

Let's build an application that displays a motivational quote. This will give you further practice in passing data to views within an Express application using EJS.

We'll create a route that selects a quote from a predefined list and passes it to an EJS template for display.

### Task:
- Complete the index.js file to store the quotes and randomly selecting one of the quote and sending it to the quote.ejs file.
- Complete the quote.ejs file to show the quotes on the webpage.

 **Hint** : You can use the following code to generate a random index between `0` (inclusive) and `quotes.length` (exclusive):

```
const randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * quotes.length);

```
